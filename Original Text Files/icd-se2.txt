Immoral Conduct Special Edition. A massive Doom-themed gameplay add-on for any and all
Doom, DoomII, and Final Doom levels.
For EDGE 1.27. May work in future versions of EDGE, but not earlier.

HOW TO PLAY:

GLEDGE32.exe -file icd-se.wad -iwad doom2.wad

For best results, add any extra wads BEFORE icd-se.wad on the above command line.
For example:
GLEDGE32.exe -file requiem.wad icd-se.wad

Also works fine with the software render version of EDGE (EDGE32.exe)
You need an iwad (main wad file) from any retail or shareware Doom game.

You can download EDGE 1.27 at http://edge.sourceforge.net


To play the included test level:
(Don't get too excited, it's just Map01 with stuff in it)

GLEDGE32.exe -file icd-se.wad icd-tst2.wad



NOTE:
Sorry this text file is so damn huge. I combined all the documentation into one file,
as I'm sure people were getting annoyed at the number of files I was including in the
zips.






=========================================================================================

:CHANNEL OPEN:

 Immoral Conduct is designed to be played either as is, or with any of your favorite
 wads. Immoral Conduct works just as well in Doom1 or Doom2, as well as Tnt or Plutonia.

 I recommend trying your luck at the Hell Revealed wads using Immoral Conduct, as well
 as Memento Mori 1 and 2, Requiem, Invasion 2, or any other level set you enjoy. Also
 works very well with 2002ado, Darken, Darken2, Icarus, Biowar, Phoenix, Phobos,
 Eternal Doom, Alien Vendetta, etc.
 Hell, it works with any Vanilla or "Lite" Boom level or level set.

 NOTE: Obviously works best with levels that DON'T use a lot of replacement sprites,
       such as Ultdtv.wad or similar. Definitely won't work with existing conversions
	 like Hacx or Strain, Aliens TC, etc.

DESCRIPTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -weapon- (map object that gives weapon)


WEAPONS:

==Class 1==

 -Knife- (free, backpack, on Space Marine corpses, dropped by troopers)
Primary Attack: Slice
Secondary Attack: Throw
Ammo Type: Knives

 The combat knife is in your inventory from the start, and is a great
 melee weapon. You can use this with berserk to deliver massive damage.
 Primary is a fast yet weak attack, yet you can occaisionally use a wide swipe
 to cause a lot more damage.
 NOTE: The closer you are to your target, the more damage you'll do.
 Use the secondary attack to throw the knife in your hand. You can pick up the knife
 after you've thrown it, if it hit a creature or bounced off a wall. Be careful not
 to lose a knife by throwing it into an unreachable area! 
 You can initially carry 5 to a maximum of 10 SPARE knives, and you have one spare 
 on you at the start. You cannot throw your last remaining knife.
 TACTICS:
 If you have a few knives, throw them instead of slashing. If you have to slash,
 get in, slash, get out, repeat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 2==

 -.45 Pistol- (free)
Primary Attack: Accurate, aimed shot
Secondary Attack: Less accurate melee shot
Ammo Type: Bullets

 You start with a pistol, and it's quite a reliable weapon. Decent
 rate of fire, good power.
 Holds 12 rounds.
 TACTICS:
 Up close or against a group of enemies, let loose with the the secondary
 attack. If you need to hit an enemy a long ways away, use primary.

 -Pistols x2- (Green Armour)
Primary Attack: Fire Left - Right
Secondary Attack: Aimed double shot
Ammo Type: Bullets

 Double speed, double capacity, but horrible accuracy.
 Use the alternate attack to fire off a quick double burst. Accurate, good for
 sniping, but if you need rate of fire, use primary instead.
 TACTICS:
 Great for running and gunning. Open fire on groups of enemies for best results.
 The closer the better, since the left pistol's shot will be very innaccurate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 3==

 -Combat Shotgun- (shotgun)
Primary Attack: Fire
Secondary Attack: Quick-toss a hand grenade
Ammo Type: Shells

 Has a high magazine capacity (8 rounds) and is quite powerful.
 It's good at medium range too. Takes a moderate amount of time to reload.
 Use the secondary attack to throw a hand grenade if you have any.
 TACTICS:
 The closer to the enemy you are, the better. ALWAYS keep an eye on your ammo,
 having to reload in the middle of a firefight could spell your doom.

 -Upgraded Combat Shotgun- (BFG9000)
Primary Attack: Fire Slasher round
Secondary Attack: Launch fragment grenade
Ammo Type: Flak Shells

 When you find an upgrade kit, your shotgun will be converted to fire 'Slasher' ammo, which
 are metal slugs that fragment when exiting the gun's barrel - and spray chunks all over.
 There isn't much that can survive a point blank shot from this. Secondary attack gives the
 added comfort of a grenade launcher, firing an un-fragmented round which explodes on
 contact with any surface. As always, be careful, because the flying metal hurts you as
 well. The downside to upgrading is that you lose the ability to fire normal
 shotgun shells, but you still have the double barreled and the sawed-off for that.
 TACTICS:
 A VERY powerful weapon. Get up close, fire. Use the secondary to clean out a room
 full of enemies. Remember, the primary fire can be bounced off of floors and walls,
 so use this to your advantage.
 As the gun and related ammo is quite heavier, it takes significantly longer to reload
 or otherwise operate.

 -Double Barreled Shotgun- (Super Shotgun)
Primary Attack: Right Barrel, Left Barrel
Secondary Attack: Both Barrels
Ammo Type: Shells

 An urban weapon, it can be useful due to it's sheer brute force at close range.
 Utterly useless at long range, so be wise. Can now be fired a single barrel at a time.
 TACTICS:
 Use the primary against small enemies, and the secondary at point-blank against large
 monsters. As stated, the buckshot spread on this gun is very loose, so get in close to
 your target.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 4==

 -Uzi Sub-machinegun- (Chaingun)
Primary Attack: Machine gun fire
Secondary Attack: Wide 10-shot melee spread
Ammo Type: Bullets

 The uzi is a fast, albeit in-accurate weapon, best for close to medium range.
 It would be a lot wiser to use your double pistols if you want rate-of-fire AND power.
 Has a 30-round magazine.
 Use the alternate attack if you find yourself cornered. You can tilt the uzi
 sideways and sweep the room with a horizontal spread of bullets.
 TACTICS:
 The spread of the primary fire goes vertically, so this weapon isn't bad at short
 to medium range. The horizontal spray of the secondary attack is great for dealing
 with a group of monsters.

 -Uzi x2- (Invulnerability)
Primary Attack: Machine gun fire
Secondary Attack: None
Ammo Type: Bullets

 Again, double everything. Uses up ammo FAST. Use in situations where you need A TON
 of lead slung towards your target. Be careful though! It takes a while to reload both
 weapons.
 TACTICS:
 None. Spray n Pray. Get in close to rip your enemies to shreds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 5==

 -Hand Grenades- (Box of Rockets)
Primary Attack: Throw
Secondary Attack: Drop
Ammo Type: Grenades

 Pull the pin, throw, and TAKE COVER. These grenades spray fragments of metal
 everywhere, and it hurts to get stung with it. VERY effective room cleaners.
 TACTICS:
 Use in small rooms or hallways for best results. Look upwards to throw farther.
 
 -40mm Grenade Launcher- (CELL PACK)
Primary Attack: Launch a grenade
Secondary Attack: Launch a gas bomb
Ammo Type: Grenades

 This modified tear-gas gun shoots explosive projectiles that bounce and
 explode. Holds five grenades. Be careful the projectile doesn't bounce back at you!
 Secondary attack costs two grenades, and fires a cannister of very deadly gas.
 The tear gas will almost instantly kill any creature with a direct hit.
 Note that the gas will disperse in a spiral pattern for about 12 seconds, and the gas
 will drift around a room or corridor until it dissipates. Be careful.
 TACTICS:
 Again, both modes of this weapon are most effective within closed spaces or
 hallways. Look upwards to get maximum distance.
 Both projectiles will explode on contact with a creature/object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 6==

 -M-16a1 Assault Rifle- (Rocket Launcher)
Primary Attack: 3-Shot Burst / full automatic
Secondary Attack: M203 grenade launcher.
Ammo Type: Rifle Ammo

 Practically the most useful weapon in the game. It's decently accurate and
 high-powered, plus has a large magazine (45 rounds), so go nuts!
 The grenade launcher is loaded SoF2-style, and fires a fast concussion grenade.
 Not the best explosives to use, but may come in handy. They will explode on contact
 with anything. The downside is that the m203 takes a while to reload.
 TACTICS:
 Concussion grenades are most effective against smaller enemies. The primary fire
 is useful against pretty much anything. Against a group of weaker enemies, fire
 a grenade and save a ton of bullets.

 -M-211 SemiAutomatic Gas-Operated Infantry Combat Weapon (Sig-Cow)- (Plasma Gun)
Primary Attack: Very Accurate High powered shot.
Secondary Attack: Stab with Bayonet
Ammo Type: Rifle Ammo

 This old-fashioned rifle may be dated, but still kicks some. Not as fast
 as your M-16, but very powerful and accurate. Has a 20 shot clip, and a sharp
 bayonet attachment, which is handy when you don't need to waste ammo or don't have
 time to switch guns.
 NOTE: The closer you are to your target, the more damage you'll do with the bayonet!
 TACTICS:
 A good all around weapon. Use the bayonet against close-up enemies, preferrably
 those without a range attack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 7==

 -MiniGun- (#2999 or dropped by Chaingun Guy)
Primary Attack: Controlled Fire
Secondary Attack: Rapid Fire
Ammo Type: Rifle Ammo

 You only get this weapon from fallen Commandos, and it uses rifle ammo. Good,
 but not the most practical weapon in the game. Uses 100-round belts. Secondary fire allows
 you to fire quicker bursts, however VERY wildly. It's best to use secondary fire
 in close quarters battle, whereas primary is better for targeting single enemies.
 TACTICS:
 See Uzi x2.

 -Sawed-off Shotgun- (#4444 or dropped by Shotgun Guy)
Primary Attack: Fire
Secondary Attack: Quick-toss a marking flare
Ammo Type: Shells

 This is an old-style wood trimmed shotgun, used extensively by the former
 soldiers (zombies). It's short barrel makes it quite less powerful than your Combat
 Shotgun, but more accurate than your double barreled. One of these will do until you find
 something better, but becomes obsolete once you find a riot gun.
 Has a six round magazine. You may find this handy because of it's shorter reload time and
 more predictable buckshot spread.
 TACTICS:
 See Shotgun. This weapon has a more horizontal spread pattern, which makes it good
 for tight groups of enemies. It's thick steel and wood construction make it quite heavy
 to operate, even with the missing barrel.
 This weapon is great for hunting in dark corridors - you can easily toss a marking flare
 without having to put away the weapon.

 -.357 Magnum Pistol- (#4446 or on Space Marine Corpses (extremely rare))
Primary Attack: Fire
Secondary Attack: None
Ammo Type: Bullets

 Select few officers carry these as sidearms, so if you're lucky, you may be able to
 find one on a corpse. This gun has a pretty stainless-steel finish, but it's all
 business none-the-less. Almost as powerful as your Sig-Cow Rifle, yet able to fire
 at a quicker rate. It has a very small capacity (6 rounds), so watch yourself.
 TACTICS:
 Aim and fire.

 -9mm Automatic Pistol- (#4445 or on Trooper Corpses (extremely rare))
Primary Attack: Fire
Secondary Attack: Burst Fire
Ammo Type: Bullets

 The old standard-issue sidearms from before the invasion. While a small and lightweight
 pistol, these tend to have little stopping power. On the plus side though, it's
 construction allows it to be fired quite rapidly and accurately. Marvel over it's sexy
 matte black finish... oooh!
 Use the secondary attack to shoot a very quick burst of 3 shots.
 TACTICS:
 This weapon tends to spread it's fire vertically, plus it's only slightly more powerful
 than the Uzi. It's rate-of-fire and magazine capacity is superior to the .45 however.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 8==

 -Sentry Turret- (comes in backpack)
Primary: Set up a turret
Secondary: Deploy MEDIBOT(TM)
Ammo Type: Turrets

 This will throw a turret on the ground, which will then deploy and search for targets
 other than yourself. Beware, it doesn't move, and can easily be disabled, but it 
 does have great stopping power. Has a somewhat limited range.
 Note that it will fire shotgun blasts up close, so try to use that to your advantage.
 
 Use the alternate attack to build and deploy a prototype MEDIBOT(TM).
 The MEDIBOT(TM) is a mobile sentry turret with 2 distinct features. It uses patented
 ARCHVILE TECHNOLOGY gathered by UAC scientists. This means the bot will ressurect
 dead monsters, which will ally with the bot to kill hostiles. Be aware, the allied
 monsters only obey the MEDIBOT(TM) and not other Space Marines (you).
 Secondly, you can use the detonator supplied with UAC DETPAK SATCHELS(R) to instruct
 the MEDIBOT(TM) to spawn a fresh medical kit at it's current position. The downside
 to this is that the bot will consume all it's power doing so, and will explode upon
 completing the task.
 The MEDIBOT(TM) is equipped with a single machine gun, and it uses a very unstable
 prototype power source. Don't be surprised if the bot explodes for no reason!
 TACTICS:
 *Sentry Turret: Place around a corner, and lure enemies into it's line-of-fire. This
 works especially well against larger monsters, since the turret will fire a barrage
 of buckshot at close enemies rather than weaker bullets at far away enemies.
 *Medibot: Once the medibot has finished killing targets, use your detonator (9) to
 make it spawn a medikit. Chances are the medibot will explode soon anyway, might as
 well get some health in case you need it.
 Both: Keep in mind you can only carry ONE of these on you at any time. I recommend
 setting turrets up IMMEDIATELY if you have the detonator (9), this way once you get
 a new backpack, you won't be losing a turret, as you can disable the previous one
 and retrieve it later.

 -Gas Powered Chainsaw- (chainsaw)
Primary: Thrust 'n Chop
Secondary: Shut it off

 A classic weapon, this one is a slightly enhanced version of the Doom
 chainsaw. You need to pull start this one, and refuel it occaisionally. A little more
 powerful and quicker than it's original counterpart, albeit a bit rusty and dirty
 from previous attacks...
 If the idle noise bothers you, hold the secondary fire button to kill the engine. When
 you let go of the button, you will start the chainsaw up again.
 TACTICS:
 Tough to use against Spectres. All other enemies are fair game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 9==

 -Satchel Charges:- (rocket)
Primary Attack: Toss a Proximity Charge
Secondary Attack: Force Detonate an Active Charge
Ammo Type: Charges

 Activate, throw, and watch the fireworks. These new and improved UAC DETPAK SATCHELS(R)
 are fully functional remote bombs / proximity mines.
 They WILL DETONATE if you get too close to an armed one, so watch out!
 Also, you CANNOT throw them directly at an enemy without them exploding! 
 A new addition, you can now detonate the satchels ANYWHERE on the current area,
 regardless of line-of-sight.
 There are still no safeties applied to armed satchels, so stay clear once you've
 armed them!
 TACTICS:
 Place these near un-provoked enemies, hide and detonate. Or, place them where you
 know enemies will walk into one. Remember, don't block your path with a satchel! 

 -Sentry Bot Remote- (comes with satchels)
Primary Attack: Undeploy any active sentry turrets
Secondary Attack: Cause MEDIBOT(TM) to spawn a medkit

 If there are MEDIBOT(TM) or Sentry turrets deployed somewhere on the current level,
 use the alternate attack of this detonator to cause the MEDIBOT(TM) to spawn a medikit.
 you'll hear the bot take 5 seconds to recharge, then your HUD will display an icon
 telling you the medikit is ready. Unfortunately, the MEDIBOT(TM)'s unstable powersource
 will likely overload during this procedure, causing the bot to explode.
 Also, the primary attack will cause any active Sentry Turrets to deactivate, so you
 can pick it up and move it elsewhere.
 TACTICS:
 See Sentry Turret
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Class 0==

 -Silenced .45 Pistol- (free)
Primary Attack: Accurate aimed shots
Secondary Attack: Quick un-aimed shots
Ammo Type: Bullets

 Adding a silencer makes you quite stealthy. Monsters cannot hear you at all.
 Great for those encounters where you don't want / can't afford to alert all the
 surrounding baddies. This allows you to deal with one monster at a time.
 Nicely accurate too, so you can snipe with it if neccessary.
 TACTICS:
 If you prefer the "silent but deadly" approach, use this instead of the normal
 pistol. Great for ambushes. Use the secondary fire to quickly belt off as many shots
 as you can (for those tight moments).

 -Marking Flares- (free)
Primary: Light and Throw a flare
Secondary: None
Ammo Type: Bullets

 These are bright, and emit a column of smoke, as well as a hissing noise, making them
 great for marking your path in unfamiliar territory. The flares have a life of about
 30 minutes, so you can take your time. Also can be used with GLEDGE and dynamic
 lighting to brighten your area.
 Try not to step on a lit flare, as stated before, they burn hot.
 Sacrifice a bullet every time you use a flare (gamism).
 TACTICS:
 Use in a dark room to light your path.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW / MODIFIED CHARACTERS:

Our Hero:
 You've learned never to come to these demon infested spaceports and moonbases
 without some protection. Your new UAC Space Marine Uniform comes equipped with
 low-level armour plating (30%).
 Your Heads Up Display Helmet (TM) has been retro-fitted with a new UAC MONSTER
 DETECTION GRID (TM,(C)), which informs you of which monster species have been 
 eradicated in a level, also it shows MEDIBOT(TM) status and displays which monsters
 are NOT on any given level.

Wolf SS:
 These guys hold uzis now. Get them for your own use! Spot the irony of Nazi soldiers
 using Jewish weapons! Hoorj! Wait for him to reload his gun, then move in for the kill.

Lost Soul:
 These annoying guys are now able to make themselves invisible, and they look different
 now too.

Other Enemies:
-Zombies now periodically reload their weapons... a good opportunity to strike them.
-Helper bots also reload.. cover them!
-Imps have loosened their tolerance on each other and will retaliate if provoked.
-Barons of Hell have developed a distaste for their weaker cousins the Hell Knights.
-Most enemies have undergone a growth spurt, honing their attack skills and raising
  their stamina. Most monsters are prone to attack more frequently as well.
-The Spider Mastermind got tired of playing second fiddle to the superior Cyberdemon,
  so it raised the protective abilities of it's platform body.
-Cyberdemons and Masterminds will attack their brethren if provoked.
-Don't approach a Mastermind or a Cyberdemon!!! They'll crush you or swat at you up close!
-Spectres and Demons will gladly chow down on each other given the chance.
-Pretty much all monsters have evolved gretter strength or tougher attacks. Be careful.

New Enemies:

NOTE:
  These enhanced zombies only appear in DOOM II or FINAL DOOM. The game uses the
  HEAVY_WEAPON_DUDE to spawn either a chaingun guy (normal) or one of the following
  zombies:
NOTE2:
  These zombies can be placed manually on a map via their (mobj #). If you want these
  guys in Doom 1, you'll have to place them manually.
 
Enhanced Trooper (3042):
 Enhanced troopers can be seen ready to fire at all times. Listen for their tell-tale
 grunt/yell before they open fire. Be careful, they are armed with full-auto uzis and
 can mow you down very quickly.
 WARNING: They have been known to suicide by dropping a live grenade at their feet.

Enhanced Sergeant (3043):
 Enhanced Shotgun Sergeants carry supershotguns and open up with both barrels. Has
 a characteristic scream before attacking, and a long reload time... use this wisely.

Enhanced Space Marine Zombie (3044):
 Listen Soldier.. our own boys are getting reworked in there, so watch out. Zombie
 Marines typically lose their helmets, so be on the look out. They fire M16s usually,
 but they have a cache of grenades on them too. We've had reports of zombies dropping
 grenades and running away, but sometimes they may pull the pin just before they die,
 leaving you a nasty farewell present.

Chainsaw Space Marine Zombie (3046):
 More than one Marine has discovered that chainsaws make good weapons... unfortunately,
 most get reworked. These guys are pretty easy to avoid, but don't let them get anywhere
 near you! They can cause massive trauma within seconds! They wear some hefty armor too.



Friendlies:

NOTE: 
  Don't expect these guys to do all the work for you. They aren't very bright. The best
  idea is to just fight like normal, and chances are the nearest helper will join you.
  You can tell who's who by the weapon they carry.
NOTE2:
  In Doom II, putting a MEGASPHERE on your map will randomly spawn one of the following.
  Also, by default, CO-OP PLAYER SPOT #4 also randomly spawns one, although not all
  the time.
  To disable the CO-OP spawner, open the DDFTHING lump, scroll to the bottom, and remove
  or comment out (//) the entire entry titled: [COOP_HELPER_SPAWNER:4]
NOTE3:
  These helpers can be placed manually on a map via their (mobj #).
PROTIP:
  If you want a helper to follow you, hit them with a pistol or uzi shot (or anything
  weak). Don't over-do it though, or they'll attack you!

*Friendly Space Marine Corporal (3048):
 Armed with an Infantry Rifle, she will help out too. A great team-mate.
 When she gets in close, she'll use her bayonet. Be sure to cover her while she reloads.

*Friendly Space Marine Private (3000):
 Armed with a supershotgun, these guys will help out until they die, or unfortunately,
 give up.. the suicide rate for new recruits is on the rise it seems.

*Friendly Space Marine Lieutenant (3045):
 These fellows watch too many action movies. Their weapon(s) of choice are 2 .45 pistols,
 one in each hand. 

*Friendly Space Marine Sergeant (3041):
 This guy will help you with his M-16. Keep him protected and he'll do your
 dirty work with ease.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL DESIGN STUFF:


Included with this release is a sample map. I've included some modified sector types
and line types for use in a custom map:

-Line Type 2003:
 -Unbreakable transparent (glass). The middle/normal texture on this line will
  become 50% translucent and will block projectiles and shots. Explosion damage will still
  get through though.

-Deep Swimmable Water (Line Type 406, Sector Type 22)
 -Tag your real sector to a dummy sector (Type 22) with Line Type 406 to achieve deep
  water. Your dummy sector's floor/ceiling controls the surface of the water, so it's
  best to make them the same value.
 -TIP: Don't make the water's surface too far below the ground, as it will become hard
  for the player to jump out of the water.
 -PROTIP: Your air capacity is ~25 seconds, and it hurts like a bastard to choke. Use
  Mlook + jump to quickly swim to the surface for a breath.
 -PROTIP2: Binding "MOVE UP" and "JUMP" to the same key may be useful, but it can cause
  you to rocket out of the water if you try too hard. 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS:

-The Box of Shotgun Shells and Big Medikit have anomalies when respawning
 items is turned on: If you only partially use either one, it will still respawn...
 no big deal really. 

-Projectiles CAN be absorbed into walls / other structures if you try hard enough.
 This applies to weapon effects such as sparks / shells / smoke etc, or other
 important projectiles like turrets, satchels, grenades and whatnot.

-I upped the hitpoints on some monsters, so regular Doom or Doom2 traps may not be as
 effective. Case in point: the crusher in map06 of Doom2 takes a lot longer to
 kill the spider mastermind (if at all). Unfortunately the crusher will stop in it's
 down position if the creature isn't killed (same with yellow key crusher on e2m5)

-The Turret weapon remote (weapon #9) uses a custom crosshair. 
 At times, especially after a load game, this will appear far too low on the screen.

-The m203 (grenade launcher on the M16) will reload even if you have no ammo left.
 It may be a bug with EDGE's SEC_CHECKRELOAD codepointer, or maybe not.

-If you're fast enough, you may be able to cause a dying Sentry Turret to undeploy
 (using the #9 detonator). This isn't really an issue, but more of a feature.
 This also applies to the MEDIBOT.

-You can skip the reload sequences of some weapons if you try to select another weapon
 right before the sequence begins. This is useful for weapons like the Shotguns,
 which take a long time to reload. A good tip for a heated firefight is to wait until
 you fire your last round, then hit the button for another weapon. This will skip the
 reload and switch to a full weapon.

-If you IDKFA or IDFA you won't be able to use all the weapons, since some upgrade others,
 and won't be available. Also, ID(K)FA gives a different armor type than actual armor
 pickups, so that is an issue as well.

-If a map has thing #0 on it (unlikely but possible), it will be replaced by a spider bot..
 not sure why, but count yourself lucky... previous versions spawned a huge explosion
 (with flak shards) as thing #0.  Weird, eh???
 I'm not sure why you'd want to place thing #0 on a map... but INVASIO2.wad Map06 is
 an example.

-For some reason falling damage applies to you if you hit the bottom of a swimmable
 water area. Also DON'T CROUCH while submerged, or great pain will ensue. The only
 way to fix this is to remove falling damage altogether, but I don't want to do that.

-If you're drowing close to the surface of water, your air bubbles may escape the surface
 and float up through the air... kinda cartoonish, but Duke3d did the same :)

May 25, 2000
-Began converting the dehacked version into the ddf version

May 27, 2000
-released the preliminary version

June 1, 2000
-released a further tweaked version

June 19, 2000
-edge 1.24 is released
-need to rename the mod, as there is already an Action Doom, and to
 avoid copyright issues
-changed many sounds, (pistol clip in, m4 clip in, sniper fire, all 3 magnum
 revolver sounds, minigun fire, NV goggles, dsclick, grenade launcher reload)
-added all SSG frames for compatibility with Ultimate Doom
-added alternate pistol sounds (ds1911, ds9mm, dspistol)
-fixed things.ddf, where double uzi's would not let you use only one.. obviously!!
-fixed things.ddf, where long sounds had been replaced with shorter ones
 to avoid crashing v1.23
-made cyberdemon attack a lot harder, with extra explosive missiles (evil grin)
-toned down the guns a little.. they were way too powerful
-toned down zombie attacks too... an accurate zombie???
-made sniper rifle come with 5 rounds instead of 10
-made sniper rifle not automatic

June 20, 2000
-made akimbo pistol attack more appropriate (less accurate)
-tweaked player attacks even more (they're ALL tweaked now)

June 21, 2000
-added a bunch of new monster sounds, mostly from Doom64
-adjusted some monster attacks and translucency
-changed the Cacodemon Lightning ball into one that looks much much cooler
-made knife attack a little more believable (a short pause between left and
 right swipe attacks)

June 22, 2000
-Fixed up some stuff in the Dehacked versions, namely replacing the ugly
 hand-cannon and making the kick more like the one in the ddf version
 Contemplated replacing the sword with the knife, but... nah!

June 23, 2000
-Got some great ideas looking at the ddf files for the QDoom demo..
-made knife attacks random left/right
-made shells fade away rather than dissappear suddenly
-hehehehe.. go gib an imp!

June 24, 2000
-tweaked imp gibbing a whole lot

June 25, 2000
-added more sounds
-added sawed-off shotgun
-moved the assault rifle a little to the right
-made barrel death randomly spawn explosion
-version 0.5 released

June 26, 2000
-started work on two tactical weapons (single player), namely
 the Sentry Turret and Proximity Charge
-finished the art, sounds, and coding of the sentry turret
 You get one in a backpack, it costs you 5 grenades, and it's in
 weapon slot 8.
-started graphic, sound and coding of the Prox Charge
 works great, but ignores me...

June 27, 2000
-did a little more work on the proximity charges, still don't work
 exactly like I want, but they will do.
-made double pistols NOT fire both if you don't want, so you can shoot
 with the left, and when you fire later, it will come from the right..
-fixed weapons firing one more time when new ammo is picked up, like if
 your shotgun runs dry on the eighth round, and later you pick up more ammo,
 when you try to shoot it will reload first (rather than firing a shot, then reloading)
 It's one step closer to realism, at least!
-reversed Hand-cannon attacks, so secondary=both barrels, primary=right/left
 more like 'Blood' I guess.
-tweaked shotgun reloads a little more, so it checks BEFORE you fire rather than
 after... I like facing down a Baron of Hell, ready my riot gun, <CLICK!!!>.. crap!
-fiddled with demon and spectre, made spectre bleed appropriately

June 28, 2000
-did more reload fixing
-certain user-levels are impossible with this mod, so I gave the player two
 extra clips at start
-fixed "dead lost soul" bug, it's now an explosion like normal

June 29, 2000
-various tiny little tweaks
-added left/right punch attack, yet to decide on placement, although you automatically
 select this when you are berserk??
-adjusted bullet weapon monsters's attack ranges
-made kick distort view a little

June 30, 2000
-gave sniper-rifle full zoom, and M16 partial zoom and no others can zoom, 
 (only if levels.ddf has "LIMIT_ZOOM" special)

July 1, 2000
-added some more frames to the Uzi reloads - much better now, but longer to reload,    especially akimbo!
-since shotgun sargeants no longer snipe, I removed extra clips at start
-put together another shotgun skin, the SPAS-12, VERY tempted to make it a permanent
 replacement!

July 2, 2000
-made grenade rounds secondary attack of the shotgun... an all-purpose assault weapon!

July 3, 2000
-made lost souls painful upon death, so no more close combat with those!
-Added alternate mode for the shotgun - flak rounds! Not in-game yet (you have to cheat)

July 4, 2000
-Made Spas-12 permanent replacement for the black generic shotgun.. sorry folks.
-Made an ALL NEW weapons system, broken into classes (see icd-ddf.txt)
-gave hand-cannon it's old sound (other sound is still in the wad)
-removed kick attack from knife... it doesn't fit in single player.

July 5, 2000
-Started refining:
-Major tweaks to:
 Shotgun - made muzzle flash, better reload animation, firing animation, no reload eject
 Assault Rifle - better firing animation, FIXED firing problem, better now.
 Akimbo Pistols - fixed very choppy reload
-Slasher Upgrade replaces Cell Pack, and REPLACES shotgun weapon with the same thing
 but with slasher rounds as secondary attack rather than grenades, and automatic
 rather than pump action.
-Spider Mastermind drops rifle ammo when killed
-'box o' ammo' gives bullets and a few rifle ammo
-made shotguns reload speeds random (random pauses reaching for shells)
-BACKUP

July 7, 2000
-better sounds for the sawed off shotgun.. the old ones were very annoying
-quieted the spent cartridges sounds
-made blood stain the ground (thanks again, QDoom!) (idea from Nightmare Squad)	
 (sprites from Legacy)

July 9, 2000
-made barrel death randomly spawn flames (rare)

July 11, 2000
-made a better pistol icon sprite
-BACKUP
 
July 12, 2000
-made pistol and uzi casings much more random (fly in different directions)
-fixed cacodemon blood puddles (too dark)
-fixed baron/hell knight blood (too bright)
-added orange blood for demon (how did I get along before??)
-fixed fire (too translucent)
-suddenly realized I can't leave good enough alone... I h8 being a perfectionist
-BACKUP

July 13, 2000
-for some reason, added a master keycard, that allows access to all locked (keycard) doors
-had some problems with imp gibs crashing the game, so I had to go back to an
 archived version from yesterday (ALWAYS BACK-UP PEOPLE!!!)
-removed master keycard (due to back-up)
-made hand cannon virtually perfect
-made imp gibs fade away after a while

July 14, 2000
-Version 0.6 released

July 17, 2000
-added a cleaner version of the Shadow Warrior Explosion (with more frames)

July 18, 2000
-added secondary gas bomb attack to grenade launcher (had to borrow sprite from
 AliensTC)
-finished up coding the gas bomb. Looks wicked! Uses two grenade ammo.

July 19, 2000
-tried fixing the grenade class switching, but no luck - all 3 weapons *are*
 selectable though!

July 22, 2000
-added different modes to the satchel charges, proximity and detonation/shootable
-also made the sprites more efficient
-fixed some bugs with the proximity charge

July 23, 2000
-fixed some problems I had with 40mm not selecting. It's still difficult to
 select between the explosives, but it is possible.
 May go with a whole new priority system.
-The uzi's were pretty useless, so I made them a bit more accurate.
-whipped up some pretty kick-ass sprites for an m203 grenade launcher,
 so I put it in... this does not make any other grenade obsolete, though....
 read the docs!
-fixed a bunch of stuff mainly involving the strength of the gas bomb
-removed the laser site from the m16.
-BACKUP

July 24, 2000
-made some changes to the blood splats, so there's only one puddle instead of three
-added another explosion, cause the old one was getting repetative
-added three new explosion sounds (from half-life)
-fiddled around with the placement of certain explosions

July 25, 2000
-12-shot shotgun shells were pretty generous, so I made them more realistic 9-shot
 don't worry, the shotguns are still quite powerful!
-got another explosion sound for the m203 (from kingpin)
-removed the cyberdemon's aiming skills... it was too hard!!
-added a crappy yet effective fragmentation effect to the hand grenades
 hopefully someone else will be able to find a better way...?
-BACKUP

July 26, 2000
-Added another weapon, the OICW Mark II (with sprites originally by Stephen Browning)
 About a whole day's work, doing all the sprite modifying, and ddf coding.
 Read the docs for more info. (Thanks again, Oniko, I used a lot of your ideas!)

July 27, 2000
-Made the OICW a new thing type, so it will only appear in custom levels. I also
 tested placing a turret and explosion on a map, and both worked.
-BACKUP

July 28, 2000
-made the female helper marine carry an OICW, and she fires it in Mode 1.
-made OICW mode 1 a little more powerful
-added muzzle flashes for modes 2 and 4
-added secondary attack to OICW mode 3
-made fire (barrels, and laser) randomly last anywhere from forever to a few seconds...
-added secondary attack to OICW mode 1

July 30, 2000
-just found out NOW that an attack can have a spare attack... dammit
 Also, if you do this: ALTERVISIBILITY:#### on a frame with a long duration (100) that
 frame will slowly, evenly fade out of existence!
-made fading crap more efficient
-added bfg attack to OICW mode 4

July 31, 2000
-Added a chainsaw, a bit better than the original one. (not in-game)
 IMHO, this chainsaw is damn nifty... look for it in a future project by me.
-Grrr.... proximity charges are being a bitch and not selecting under the idfa cheat!!!
 So are a few others: Silenced pistol, upgraded shotgun...   I guess you'll just
 have to play the game if you want to see all the weapons..
-Removed compensator holes from pistol silencer
-Silenced pistol replaces non-silenced when aquired (may be temporary)
-Fixed up SMOK entries (they now float properly)

August 1, 2000
-removed FACE_TARGET from zombie attacks, so now they aren't perfectly accurate
-did a bunch of miscellaneous tweaks to the chainsaw, and added a secondary function.
-worked on fixing up the auto-pistol from DC2

August 2, 2000
-did a small test: if you use the chainsaw exclusively, and got 100% kills, you'd be
 on map04 of Doom2 (UV) before you had to refuel
-made it so certain sounds can only be heard within a specific distance (casings, silencer)
-finished up the sprites for the autopistol, and put in in the mod.. man its fast!
-Put in some marking flares.. in the tools section (sprites from AliensDoom3 beta)
-made the minigun's secondary fire more useful
-now the explosive charges (both) won't select!!! I think it has to do with the fact that
 there is way too many weapons???? Come on... only 28! I think edge could use a 
 prev/next weapon button that will cycle through ALL aquired entries in weapons.ddf
-BACKUP

August 3, 2000
-tried messing around with a flashlight... worked okay, but not great
-to ease simplicity, combined both proximity and remote charges... now 40mm won't select
 under idfa cheat!!
-added 40-some new quit messages... try and guess the sources!
-added shortcut keys to godmode (g) and night vision (n)

August 4, 2000
-tried making the casings do a random death (instead of always on their side) but it
 didn't work... I know it can be done.. 
-marking flares no longer select under the idfa cheat
-added laser sight to autopistol (extremely buggy - wakes up monsters, pisses off helpers)
-fixed hands for turret launcher
-made grenades a little less easy to throw...

August 5, 2000
-BACKUP

August 7, 2000
-3 days... am I losing interest? No, just working on two "other" projects of mine...
-made muzzle flash for m203
-gave shotgun reload 1 more frame, so you actually push the shell into the magazine

August 12, 2000
-added more reload frames for the M16
-added a skill selection graphic.. so I was bored okay?
-tried an explosion (for the m203) from hexen.. no luck..
-now that I'm well under way with another project, I can remove the weapons from
 this one that were just tests

August 20, 2000
-added a fuck-load (2 words??) of crosshairs.. now I know why I haven't done it thus far:
 it looks like shit. Oh well. I wish they would be scaled down like zdoom's crosshairs,
 but no. Edge seems to not want to display them properly, so screw it. They're there,
 like 'em or not.
-the lack of work? when my other project gets released, look at the build history, and
 you'll find out why!
-I still can't understand why you can't select some guns when you have them all!
 The only weapons that have any priority are the ones that replace the default doom
 slots, so logic would dictate, that I should be able to easily switch between all
 the others, as they all have -1 priority, right?

August 21, 2000
-started re-doing the crappy sniper rifle sprites. In retrospect, I should have left well
 enough alone, as converting ~15 frames from 3d to sprites is a massive Pain in the Ass...
 Well, at least it will have reload frames now, instead of that gay goldeneye shit.
-okay.. finished with the sniper rifle. It was about 6:00pm when I started, and now it's
 1:00am, and I had supper in there as well. So I just put in about 6 hours of work!
 Anyway, the gun looks MUCH MUCH better now! I must have used a different technique 
 when I did the old sprites, but these ones look like they should - a big friggin
 rifle! Too bad the doom palette has very little green... oh well, just pretend its
 camouflage!

August 22, 2000
-did quite a few misc. adjustments - Added a better icon for the sniper rifle,
 changed the secondary attack of the unsilenced single pistol, made the sniper rifle's
 attack far less extreme (more or less Oniko Hakubi's armor piercing effect), 
 made the 'other' shotguns (besides the combat shotgun) a lot more useful.

August 23, 2000
-added a crappy 8-frame explosion from Quake2
-changed the documentation to the standard cdrom.com template

August 24, 2000
-added sort of a ricochet effect to the magnum revolver.. shooting it directly into a wall
 at point blank isn't a good idea
-cleaned 8 megs of wasted space from the wad!
-BACKUP (?)

August 27, 2000
-decided to play around with the sprite_scale stuff.. I think I went a bit overboard!!!
 Tons of stuff is now re-sized, ranging from casings to smoke, to things, etc!!
-reverted everything back to normal, and included the scaled crap as a seperate option.
-removed the crappy crosshairs and made it a seperate option

August 28, 2000
-Version 0.7 released

October 13, 2000
-has it been so long?
-Got some groovy sprites for a new shotgun, and am in the process of putting them in.
 EDGE likes to screw up the display of tall sprites... very bad in this case.

-Added much more ammo capacity (which was bugging me for a long time) 

November 1, 2000

 Also from the ALPHA doom

January 1, 2001
-The new millenium! been on a SoF binge lately...
-Added tons o' end quotes... now up to 70!
-Added general sources for all the end quotes in Language.ldf (ddflang)

January 2, 2001
-Made semi-automatic weapons (pistols, sig-cow) not have a constant fire rate,
 That way they're not just like slow automatic weapons.

January 8, 2001
-Removed the magnum revolver, cause I never used it, and it sucked..
-Added 2 weapons.... Relax, they're cheat-only!
-Reduced pistol capacity to 12 - more realistic for a 45, and it makes the single
 uzi more useful, as it can fire 6 more times.....

January 9, 2001
-Changed most of the casings to spread a little more
-BACKUP

January 13, 2001
-Changed cheater rifle into a real semi-auto

January 14, 2001

January 19, 2001
-BACKUP

January 21, 2001
-fixed animation for random SSG reload

January 24, 2001
-commented out the random imp gibbage - I got bored with it.
-fixed cheater rifle (was always accurate)
-removed (for the time being) the proximity effect of the satchel charges
 (it sucked anyway, cause it wouldn't recognize you, and I'd always get blown up in
  close quarters anyway...)

January 27, 2001
-made alt SSG reload less likely to occur
-made big medikit heal up to 150%
-Removed said cheater weapons
-reverted proximity on satchel charges (made 'smaller' too, hopefully fix wall exploding)

January 30, 2001
-made some very minor adjustments (sprites and DDF wise)
-removed alternate SSG reload
-made SSG reload more like original Doom - shells fall out when you open
 the breech.. contemplated removing left/right and only having both simultaneous fire, but
 left the attacks like they are... for now.

February 3, 2001
-radically changed the upgraded shotgun - now it's more like UT's flak cannon, which was
 what I was going for in the first place.
-added a great big explosion for the satchel charges..
-made m203 actually useful

February 7, 2001
-replaced the crappy '5-rifle bullets' with a clip instead.
-made zombie shotgun a little more like the original doom one (attack wise)
-made muzzle flashes on all pistols much better

February 12, 2001
-Ever so slightly adjusted the direction of the SSG flashes
-Changed all three shotgun icons just a little (amazing how much a few pixels can do!)

February 13, 2001
-Made a slight adjustment to the pistol's locked slide frames.. more proportionate now.
-Made grenade fragment effects vastly improved (super easy fix too! I'm an idiot)
-Made Gas bomb perfect (with same technique as above)

-BACKUP

February 14, 2001

-Removed shortcut cheats 

February 16, 2001
-Added a couple more end quotes and fixed a related bug
-Added marking flares to backpack instead of free
-Vastly improved the left hand on the M16 - still a little weird, but much
 better than the old one.
-Added a reload sequence to the M16 (cocking the bolt back)
-Cleaned *10 MEGS* from the wad in unused resources! ouch!

February 17, 2001
-Recompiled the wad with Deutex, sorted all the resources, etc. May even run better
 on slower machines now?
-Inadvertantly fixed the bug where you couldn't select the upgraded shotgun under the
 IDF(K)A cheat, as well as the silenced pistol... must have to do with the sorting?
-Fixed area on hands (turret weapon) to be more smooth where I removed the brass knuckles
-Reverted old pistol alt-attack, and enhanced it some

February 18, 2001
-Made the minigun belt-fed instead of drum-fed.. now people will hopefully stop confusing
 it with the Shadow Warrior shotgun
-A couple more end quotes
-Changed the pickup messages all around

February 19, 2001
-BACKUP

February 20, 2001
-Changed the minigun icon to match weapon (belt fed)

February 21, 2001
-Added a suppressor to the single uzi.. now I just have to figure out how
 to put it in the game (probably comes with a silencer kit, but how??)
-Changed some old sounds, most relating to the uzis and pistol reload

February 22, 2001
-reverted Uzi's back to normal, made suppressed uzi have all the new sounds,
 and is currently only available as a cheat.
-fixed up the shape of the uzi suppressor
-fixed a few pixels that were out of place on one of the pistol frames
-Darkened the knife handles on the sig-cow bayonet
-Added reload frames for the sig-cow (polishing them took many hours, dammit)

February 23, 2001
-BACKUP

February 24, 2001
-Made the knife more beefy looking, sort of like either Opposing Force or SoF,
 and reverted the old random style attack (while maintaining the secondary) 
-Brought back the fist, but called it [unarmed], and is different
 than before (only right punch)
-Unfortunately, doing so (plus adding the suppressed uzi) again broke the selection
 of the custom shotgun and the silenced pistol...
-commented out the [unarmed] weapon, to fix the selection bug (20 weap max??)
-made the custom shotgun a touch more accurate, so it's useful inside 10 feet now..
-sorted out the contents of the backpack
-added 2 more backpacks (see description)

 no saving for later!

-Fixed wad offsets of some things so they no longer sink into the

-Sorta fixed minigun icon.. just shortened the bullet chain - I liked it better before.

September 10, 2001

September 15, 2001

March 22, 2002
-Fiddled around with a scripting system

March 23, 2002
-Swapped DEAD_LOSTSOUL with UNSTABLE_BARREL to prevent uncompatibility in maps
 that included the dead lost soul near the player at first...
-Ran into an anomaly:
 If a map contains THING # 0, it will substitute a very high yield explosion
 WITH fragmentation, so chances are it will kill the player if he's anywhere
 near (invasion2 map06). I tried to write a non harmful thing 0 entry for things.ddf,
 but edge ignored it.

 make it less gorey

-put the silenced pistol back in class #2 for the time being

-Added seperate sound for the armour bonus
-Added player effects to helper bots
-Removed above script experiment, and reverted weapons to their previous behavior
-Fixed a minor perspective error on the knife (again)
-Started working on a new set of sprites for the satchel (to get rid of the OpFor

 Started replacing the opfor hand on the existing sprites with the Doom hands, and
 it looks good so far.

April 8, 2002

-enhanced the initial animation of the tear gas attack of the 40mm
-ever so slightly quickened the animation of the shotgun reloads

 save for innaccuracy in the frags themselves. My math must have sucked before...

June 30, 2002

July 3, 2002
-managed respawning for stuff.
-Improved visuals of the respawn, teleport, and item respawn flashes.

 better loop transition.

July 18, 2002

 into an "Akimbo Pistols Marine"... let's hope it looks good in the game.
-Added the double pistols marine, and surprisingly it looks pretty badass!
-updated ddfdesc2.txt
-updated design_notes.txt
-went through a lot of the gettable items and scaled them accordingly... things were
 a little too big in contrast to characters/things.
-Added a random helper bot in place of the coop start #2
-Added fleshy impact noises to blood splats

July 19, 2002

 detonate barrel
-Fixed the rifle icon, .45 and 9mm clip icons re: smoothing in GL
-Added bullet detail to dropped 9mm clip

July 20, 2002
-Was fucking around with the VOLUME command earlier, so I had to revert everything.
 The Doom engine (and hence Edge) just can't seem to do ambient sounds properly. I find
 that in Edge, sounds carry their volume too far, as opposed to Vanilla Doom or ZDoom...
-Made helper Marine spawner sometimes (rarely) not spawn anything at all.
-Made blood sound a little "fleshier"
-Fixed more sounds.. seems the VOLUME command makes the wavs sound horrible
-There was a bug with the new way I had the m203 reloading, so I reverted back
 to reload after every shot.
-Added the armor vest pickup sound from DC
-Spent the better part of the night pasting Doyoon Kim's Player heads onto Mark Quinn's
 Chainsaw Marine... also had to do some fancy work on the death frames, again
 using both authors' work as quides.. here's to hoping it looks good in game. I have
 eye-strain now, so I'm going to bed. Or at least away from the computer...

July 21, 2002
-Got the chainsaw Marine into the game, and I must say it looks good. It works quite
 well also. I had to fix the attack frames... the graphics I had to start with were
 non-animated.

July 24, 2002
-Cleaned 9 megs of space out of the wad
-BACKUP - because I'm going to try something that I know is gonna break a lot of stuff..
-okay, managed to NOT fuck everything up. Got the Kill Icons to work as well with
 randomly spawned zombies... I mean, it's not perfect.. it appears EDGE only has 30
 available RTS tip slots (the docs say it has 40...). Anyway, the kill scripts aren't
 perfect, but it's better than nothing. I'm not sure just yet how this spawning will
 affect the kill tally at the end of the level just yet, so I'll have to do some play-
 testing.
-replaced the mega sphere (which was previously the space marine corporal), with a random
 helper generator (like the #4 co-op spot)

July 25, 2002
-Scaled the imp attack down just a fraction... it looked odd before, even though I scaled
 the imp itself UP...
-Added a sprite buffer around the 40mm casings. Damn, I hope future versions of EDGE
 will be able to blend the edges of sprites better... think of all the wasted space in
 the wad I've had to add.
-Tweaked the stock shotgun... I was always unimpressed by it, as it was so slow (but it
 sort of had to be for the animation to look right), so I said screw it, and made it
 actually useful (albeit quite unrealistically fast). Now to add an alt-attack :)
-Changed (slightly) the behaviour of the double pistol attacks
-Added a somewhat cool alt-attack to the shotgun, but removed it. No use for it.
-Out of NOWHERE I completely re-did the pistol and silenced pistol reload sprites...
-Removed the clip from the pistol and silenced pistol weapon bmp's and used the actual
 projectile clips instead.
-Tweaked animation and properties of the spent pistol clips

July 26, 2002
-Put spectres' blood back the way it was before (totally spectre-ish)

-enhanced the double pistols reload animation
-nulled and/or removed unused pistol frames in the wad

-AARRGH... for the last 2 days I've been trying to find a GOOD pistol slide noise.
 -Tried the ones from CS, but I can't filter out the background noise/echo effect
 -The one from Kingpin/RtCW is *perfect* but it's too short (and sounds crappy in-game)

 -If EDGE could play sounds other than 11025kHz/8 bit/mono I'd be the freakin mayor
-Added player and male helper coughing effect for gas bomb

 finish. It's going to be rare as hell anyway, even if it is kinda useless.

 sounds don't screw things up
-Made the Flak shotgun's sounds come from the gun rather than the projectiles
-Cleaned up the Kill Icons 2 D XTREEEEEEM.... that is, they all line up perfectly now
-Just for kicks I made an alternate weapons.ddf that removes all the reloads...

 glass techniques I need for DC1... It's hard to get something that is a good
 compromise between functionality and asthetics... I can get one or the other, but
 not both. Hmm.
-For kicks, I ran the wad using the software version of EDGE. It looks pretty cool, the
 new particle effects stand out a LOT more, so firing the shotguns looks more violent :)

 on-screen position a bit.

Icd-ddf Design Notes:

This is here for public interest and my own documentation really. Maybe
you're interested in the finer details of what went into making this mod.


SPRITE MODIFICATIONS:
In order of appearance in the main wad:


PIST
GPIS
SPIS
PISG
Original Source:
-Duke Nukem 3d (pistol sprites)
-Doom (hands)
Modifications:
As you can tell, I had to modify these sprites A LOT considering their main source.
I originally needed these sprites for the pistol in Don's Challenge 2 (way back).
UPDATE: Shortened the arms on some of the frames.

BFGG
HGN1
Original Source:
-Powerslave (grenade and projectile)
-Doom (hands)
Modifications:
Although a shitty game in itself, Powerslave offers a few good resources. I had to
enlarge the tiny grenade icon to make the grenade you hold in your hand, and I also
had to shrink the projectile sprites to about 45%.

GREN
GRNF
Original Source:
-Shadow Warrior
Modifications:
I had to remove the gay Shadow Warrior arm band from the hands.

GRNL
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
If you look close enough, this is a very cut-down version of the Doom rocket
sprite.

GASL
Original Source:
-Justin Fisher's AliensTC
Modifications:
None.

SHT2
Original Source:
-Doom2
Modifications:
I added a bigger hand to the idle frame. Copied the firing frames onto the weapon
itself, and used a cut-down version of the firing frames for the left-right barrel
animation.
Also, I made alternate reload sequences with existing Doom hands and some parts
from scratch.

SAWD
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
I removed the sight on the idle frame, and cut the barrel back on the action
frames. I copied the muzzle flash onto the weapon, used the barrel reflection from
the supershotgun, and resized the recoil frame. I used Doom hands to make the
reload animation.
UPDATE: Used some sprites I made for DC1 and re-did almost all the SAWD frames. I
lengthened the slide travel, shrunk the hand, removed the bright glare on the side of
the gun, and enhanced the reload animation.

CHRG
Original Source:
-Opposing Force
-Doom (hands)
-Doom (projectile)
Modifications:
Added Doom hands to the satchel and detonator (modified punch hand)
Added a little red and yellow LCD light to the detonator.
The projectile sprites are heavily modified backpack sprites from Doom.

CHGG
Original Source:
-TNT Team's PlatoonTC
-Doom
Modifications:
I added the m203 grenade launcher, heavily modified some Doom hands and used them
for the support arm and cocking animations.
I also enhanced the reload animation quite a bit. The original had none.

M203
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
These used to be Doom's rocket explosion frames. I pasted them onto the M16, then
cut out the unused part to make a muzzle flash for the m203.

SAWG
Original Source:
-Doom
-An old gore wad I played a long time ago
Modifications:
I added the pull string animation and the missing hand for the reload, recolored the chain
teeth so it looks rusty, cut-n-pasted some blood onto the blade sides.

FLRG
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
Basically just a Doom hand, with a black line coming out of it. I added the "M-94"
text after seeing the flares Ripley used in Aliens.
I also used a tilted, enlarged portion of Doom's "small red torch" for the
burning animation.

FLAR
Original Source:
-Michael Gummelt's Aliens3beta
Modifications:
I recolored the flare part black, and made the sprite look like it was lying horizontal
rather than on an angle.

SHTG
SHTF
REMG
Original Source:
-Duke Nukem 3d
-Doom
-Half Life
Modifications:
Obviously I added heavily modified Doom hands (to the SHTG), and moderately
modified Doom pistol hands (to the REMG), and topped it off with a muzzle flash
from Half-Life.
I had to build the slide handle from scratch (for the REMG reload frames).

RIFL
RIFF
BAYG
RIFR
Original Source:
-Doom Alpha 4
-Doom
Modifications:
I added the bayonet to the idle frame (A4 had it seperate), then I recolored the
handles of the knifes, added a modified shotgun muzzle flash, and tilted the idle
frames (and removed the original hand, added a different hand) to create the 
reload frames.

UZIG
UZ2G
UZI2
Original Source:
-Shadow Warrior
-Doom
-Blood
Modifications:
Added Doom hands to ALL frames, including some very modified ones for the reload
animation. Used muzzle flashes from Blood instead of the crappy ones from SW.
A lot of repetative work went into these, but I'm proud of the way they turned out.

KNIF
THRW
KNFE
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
Just Doom's punch hands, with a scratchbuilt knife. I used the knife from 
Twilight Warrior as a guide to get the metal shine to look right, but that's all.
The projectile (also used for M_SKULL1 and M_SKULL2), where done from scratch.

MING
MINF
Original Source:
-Shadow Warrior
-TNT Team's PlatoonTC
Modifications:
Removed the drum from the Shadow Warrior shotgun, added the chain of bullets from
PlatoonTC's M-60. Slightly modified the firing animation and removed the opening
chamber port.

I removed the brass knuckles from the Doom punch sprites, and copied them into a
mirror position.

UZI3

-Shadow Warrior
-Doom
Modifications:
Big time modification here. I pushed the pixels of the SW Uzi sprite around to get a
"down the barrel" look, then I tilted the sprite, and added it to a tilted and tweaked
Doom hand. A lot of work for such a minor sprite.

SPL*
Original Source:

These are distorted versions of Doom's BLUD* sprites and Doom2's puddle of blood.

PSTR*
Original Source:
-Doom
Modifications:
Opened up the berserk box sprite (like the medikits)

FCAN*
Original Source:
-Doom2
Modifications:
No physical modifications, but I changed the offsets in the wad so the sprites
pivot on the middle of the barrel instead of on the edge.

CSAWA0
Original Source:
