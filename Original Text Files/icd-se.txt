Description             : The ultimate weapons mod. This here is the only
                          reason you need to get a copy of EDGE. Cory has
                          attained the perfect gameplay balance, allowing
                          this mod to quite literally make a new spin on
                          Doom without making things too difficult or too
                          easy.

* Copyright / Permissions *

From ICD-SE2.TXT:
"Please do NOT use any part of this package as a base for your own work.
You'll notice I did extensive modifications to the sprites I used,
so if you *must* have the same weapon, get the original and use that instead.
Contact me if you need help with that (I will not do the work for you).

So do NOT extract stuff from icd-ddf.wad;
However:
Please DO create levels/wads that are dependent on icd-ddf.wad to run. This
means as long as you make your wad so that the user has to download icd-ddf.wad
or icd-se.wad SEPERATELY, I don't mind at all. Just don't redistribute this
package or anything within. Please."

I'm not sure if Cory Whittle had anything against people redist'ing
his WAD file, because there was nothing in the text file about it,
and he did not reply to my email after three days of sending. I
(WildWeasel) think that Immoral Conduct is the best weapons mod to date,
and it deserves far better honor than to be stuck on 3D Downloads with
its download queues.

But just to be safe, don't redistribute this file past uploading it
to the IDGames archives - just in case Cory gets mad at me.
